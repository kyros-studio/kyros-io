ðŸš§ **Kyros** is an open-source data platform focused on providing cloud-agnostic, modular solutions for data engineering and infrastructure management. Our mission is to offer a customizable, scalable, and affordable alternative to proprietary platforms like Databricks, without vendor lock-in. 

Kyros is designed to leverage affordable hosting options and allows users to deploy only the components they need, keeping both complexity and costs low. Whether you're running small-scale operations or managing large, complex data environments, Kyros adapts to your needs.

## Notable Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Configure Kyros to deploy only what you need for cost-effective and efficient operations.
- **Cloud-Agnostic**: Run on any cloud or local infrastructureâ€”no vendor lock-in.
- **Built for Big Data**: Use Apache Spark for large-scale data processing, dbt for pipelines, and Flink for real-time stream processing.
- **Modern Data Formats**: Supports Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Pinot for robust, transactional data lakes and real-time OLAP queries.
- **Kubernetes-Ready**: Seamless orchestration for scaling and deployment across cloud environments.
- **Customizable Interfaces**: Fully customizable interfaces with integrations for JupyterLab, SQLPad, and Portainer.
